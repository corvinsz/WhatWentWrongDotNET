# WhatWentWrongDotNET

A program to catch and display runtime errors in .NET applications.

![Showcase](https://github.com/corvinszimion/WhatWentWrongDotNET/assets/43533385/45a51311-b3b6-4fac-9e91-27505231c57e)

# Background information

Usually you can track runtime errors in [Windows' event-viewer](https://learn.microsoft.com/shows/inside/event-viewer). When it comes to terminal server solutions though, often times unhandled runtime errors aren't logged in the clients event-viewer, but rather in the servers. Making it extra painful to track bugs. Hence the need for this application.

(Please don't mind the german error message in the gif above)
